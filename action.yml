  steps:
    # We cannot reference $GITHUB_ACTION_PATH in the path to other actions, but we can symlink it to a known location and then reference that location.
    # This ensures that the path to the action stays the same even if the runner starts storing actions in different locations or the action is being run from a fork with a different name.
